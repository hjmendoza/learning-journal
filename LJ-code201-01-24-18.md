The majority of today’s class was spent on code demo today which was extremely helpful. Before class started, I had functioning code for one of my objects for Lab 6. However, during demo, I learned so many new ways to simplify my existing code — which is great! Additionally, I became more familiar with constructor functions. Here’s an example:


``` function MakeLocation(
  name,
  minCustPerHour,
  maxCustPerHour,
  avgCookieSoldPerHour
) {
  //a function called MakeLocation will be a template for creating new objects that represent other locations
  //the statements in this function add properties and or methods to the objects
  //the this keyword is used instead of the object name to indicate that th property or method belongs to the object that this function creates
  //this function has four parameters and each one sets the value of a property in the object
  this.name = name;
  this.minCustPerHour = minCustPerHour;
  this.maxCustPerHour = maxCustPerHour;
  this.avgCookieSoldPerHour = avgCookieSoldPerHour;
  //why is this an array?
  this.randCustByHour = [];
  this.cookiesSoldByHour = [];
  this.totalCookies = 0;
  allLocations.push(this);
  //using the this keyword in front of the method to show that the method belongs to the object that this function creates
  // this.calcRandCustByHour = function() {
  // METHODS GO HERE
  //THINK ABOUT PROTOTYPES
  // }
}
//remember to call the METHODS in the constructor that are now prototypes available to the new objects the constructor will MakeLocation
// this.calcRandCustByHour();

//call the functions in a function if you want
//this constructor function creates five new objects with their own unique values used in properties of this object (name, minCustPerHour, maxCustPerHour, avgCookieSoldPerHour)
function makeStands() {
  new MakeLocation("First and Pike", 23, 65, 6.3);
  new MakeLocation("SeaTac Airport", 3, 24, 1.2);
  //make one for each store
}
makeStands();

```
## Overall

I am becoming more comfortable with writing functions/methods and am learning to appreciate objects and javascript functionality as a whole. Working on Salmon Cookies is challenging but building such a dynamic website is exciting. I look forward to developing this project in the coming weeks.
