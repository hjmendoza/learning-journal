Today was MLK, Jr Day so class was optional.
I did not attend co-work and instead used today to get caught up on previous class material. (e.g. CSS box model, readings, etc.)
## Things I learned today:
- Margin > Outline >Border > Padding > Content
- Outline is drawn outside the elementâ€™s border and may overlap with other content. Not part of element dimensions. Outline includes width, style (required), color
- Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
- Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
- See reading discussion notes on HTML/CSS Chapter 15 on Canvas 
## Things I need to work on:
- Loops in JavaScript
- Styling boxes 

So far, my experience with CodeFellows has been positive. I have learned so much in this past week. I know that these next several weeks will be challenging (especially with my day job) but I know that with practice, I will be able to become comfortable with all the new material headed our way.
