## More CSS
` margin: auto ` horizontally centers the element within its container. Will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split evenly between right and left margins
` display: inline-block ` creates a grid of boxes that fills the browser width and wraps nicely, without using ` float ` 
## Debugging Workflow
- check browser console & resolve all error messages
⋅⋅- look at file name, line number of error, and error time
- check for useful linter messages near error source
- console log the values you are trying to work with
- note all the places in your code that define or modify the value you are working with 
- try commenting htings out, then adding htem back. work backward until you find the first source of error
- try calling functions or inspecting vars in console (is value named correctly? defined? right type? etc.)
- inspect HTML elements (do all elements exist in HTML? correct hierarchy? element actually have an even attached? etc)
## Overall
The upcoming wireframe exercise will be extremely beneficial to my CSS skills growth. Class is wrapping up quickly now - only 1 more prject to go before project week. It's time to start thinking about project ideas. First, I have to consider what is feasible with my current skillset. I am looking forward to seeing what's possible.
