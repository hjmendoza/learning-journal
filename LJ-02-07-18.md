## Useful tips
- Use the ` debugger ` keyword to go through code line by line
- Create a new repo on the command line using:
``` 
git init 
git add .
git  commit -m “first commit” 
git remote add origin [[git url]] 
git push -u origin master 
```
- Use gitignore.io
- Semantic code: thoughtful, well-planned out, readable code. 
## Overall
It's crazy how fast this class is coming to an end. I am glad to be done with Salmon Cookies and am looking forward to starting a new project, BusMall, wherein I can continue to develop my JS skills. Everyone has great project ideas so far and I am excited to see how they all turn out.
