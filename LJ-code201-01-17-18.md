##Git Branching
-‘git branch’ lists all the branches that exist in your local repo and indicate which one you’re on
-Ask your dev team to implement fixes and features on branches
-‘git checkout branch-name’ takes branch name as an argument and moves you to that branch
-‘git checkout -b new-branch-name’ will create a branch with the new name and move you to it
-Try to keep a simple naming convention, i.e. all lowercase letters
-When you do a push, you always include the name of the branch that you are on locally after origin
	-ex: git push origin git-notes

##Global v Local scope
```
var x = 15;

function foo() {
    console.log('I am outside of bar: ' , x);
    function bar() {
        //local scope x=25;
        var x =25;
        console.log('I am inside of bar: ', x);
    }
    bar();
}
foo();
```
In general, local scope allows for quicker and cleaner websites and code. 

##Overall
I am starting to become more comfortable with styling in CSS. Particularly, being able to predict what a webpage will look like just from looking at the code. I know  I need to review functions in greater detail. In general, I understand their core concepts but need practice to become comfortable writing them and implementing them in my own code. Tomorrow will be our first introduction to pair programming. I am eager to learn about all its benefits!
