We spent most of today’s class in code demo for BusMall - which was much appreciated! I was stuck on how to get my counters set up. I sought help from TAs/401 students(?) but ultimately was not able to fulfill the requirements. After today’s class I am certain I can go back and fix what I was missing. Though it was reassuring to know that I was on the right track. We also discussed final project ideas today. There are a lot of great ones! I would be happy to work on any team. This week will be spent catching up on missed assignments and wrapping up Bus Mall. I am no where near as comfortable as I want to be with events/event listeners so I am hoping to get some more practice with those as I continue working on this lab.
