## Objects
- Ex of an object (and object within object):
```
var wolf = {
    name: 'Gray',
    packNum: 9,
    gender: 'female',
    age: 7,
    territory: 'North Cascades',
    alpha: true,
    yellowEyes: true,
    family: {
        mate: {
            name: 'Black'
        },
       pups: [
           'Larry', 
           'Curly', 
           'Mo'
        ] 
    },
    speak: function() {
        console.log('My name is ' + wolf.name + ' and I like to roam around in the ' + wolf.territory + '.');
        console.log(this.family);
    }
};  
```
- Can create objects within objects
- Stick to dot.notation for now
- To access properties of an object, you must go layer by layer
	- Ex: to get to the pups property, must do wolf.family.pups
## Document Object Model (DOM)
- Specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window
[DOM tree] (https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAjcAAAAJGViZWJkYmNiLTZhY2MtNDdhZC1iZDExLTQ2YmY1YzJiYTUyYg.jpg)
## Overall
The speed of the class is picking up now. I realized that the real learning occurs outside of the classroom - through practice, cowork, labs, etc. Today, we were introduced to the infamous Salmon Cookies project. I am eager yet nervous to begin. I look forward to testing my knowledge and growing my skillset.
