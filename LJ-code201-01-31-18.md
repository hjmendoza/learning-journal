## Wireframes
Aim to use very simple and professional monotone colors. Can use image placeholders from placehold.it which provides dimensions and makes it easier to style boxes/images. Wireframe process: 
 * Have a design concept and plan completely ready before you write code 
 ⋅⋅* Wireframe should show all document dimensions, use placeholder images, use ipsum txt
* Set up the project repository, scaffold the files, and make sure they are wired together. ACP
* Build out all HTML without applying classes or IDs. ACP.
* Working top to bottom, put elements into place with CSS, use structure of HTML to create selectors wherever possible. Only use IDs/classes when necessary. ACP.
* Apply color, backgrounds, borders, text styling, etc. to design specs. ACP

## Overall
Feeling better about forms. Still need to add a total footer to my cookies table. Going over wireframes was extremely helpful because styling in CSS has always the most time consuming parts of past projects — I would randomly apply CSS and hope that it would get my webpage to look how I wanted (though that was rarely the case). I’m definitely looking forward to spending more time styling my front-facing pages on Saturday.
