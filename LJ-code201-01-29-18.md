# Forms & Events
## Forms
Think about your forms and how you design them (be thoughtful of your user)

Form demo:
``` html
    <form id="store-form">
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Add Store Location</legend>
        <label for = "storename">Name of Location: </label>
        <input name = "storename" type = "text" />
        <label for = "mincust">Minimum Customers per Hour: </label>
        <input name = "mincust" type = "text" />
        <label for = "maxcust">Maximum Customers per Hour: </label>
        <input name = "maxcust" type = "text" />
        <label for "avgcook">Average Cookies per Sale:</label>
        <input name = "avgcook" type = "text" />
        <button type = "submit">Create a New Store</button>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
```

## Overall
I am becoming way more comfortable with manipulating the DOM now. I also realized that following along on my computer with the code demos far better suits my learning style than just listening. Furthermore, I realized that it is crucial to keep up with readings in order to maximize my success in the class.
