## Local Storage Notes
- json: javascript object notation. A common format for us to convert our code. It transforms your code into less binary. 
- ` JSON.stringify(obj) ` will turn object into string
- ` JSON.parse(jsonObj) ` will turn string back into original integer form
-	However this will not be the same as the original passed-in object. The parse method changes the data and changes its format. 

```
//enoding it or setting it in the database
JSON.stringify();
localStorage.setItem();
localStorage.getItem();
// retrieving it from the database and turning it back into JS
localStorage.getItem();
JSON.parse();
```
## Overall
I definitely need to review my notes/text. I am feeling pretty lost regarding local storage but I know after review, things will start to click.
