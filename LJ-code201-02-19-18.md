Today was our last lecture class before project week! We were assigned two labs today - mainly to be completed within our groups. My group and I established our group agreement today. Based off today, I think moving forward, this will be a great group to work with. I began pair programming with Katerina today. I feel like our skills are all matched and believe that as a group, we can resolve any and all conflicts that come our way. I am nervous yet somewhat excited to begin project week. I know it will be a lot of work but I look forward to accomplishing such a large project.
