# LJ Code 201 - Day 2 - January 10 2018
Today we started our second lab project, About Me.
We learned how to link together our index HTML file to our js and css files.
Code snippet: 
```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>About Me</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>All About Me</h1>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Documentation
In addition, we learned the importance of documentation -- a series of documents that describe what a code does and how to use it. 

We used documentation to learn how to create respositories on GitHub
    See link: https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-201n10/blob/master/class-02-intro_js_html_css-arrays/setting-up-a-new-project.md

Documentation is invaluable and will be extremely helpful as time goes on, especially when it comes to final projects!  

## Git and GitHub
Git: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency

Git command basics:
Provides a detailed description of current state in working directory: git status

Include file/s in staged/tracked status of working directory; you can use . as a wildcard to capture all files: git add <file/s> 

Snapshot the tracked changes in current working directory, with a brief message describing the changes: git commit -m "Your commit message"

Push local commits to GitHub: git push <destination> <branch>

Lastly, Add, Commit, Push (ACP) to keep GitHub up to date. 
    Add add files from your local system to your repository
    Commit saves changes
    Push pushes changes to repository 

All in all, right now, I'm struggling most with learning the concepts of Git and exactly how it works. I could definitely benefit from reviewing some online tutorials.
